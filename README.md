# AI Dungeon Master

A full-stack web application that uses the Anthropic Claude API to act as an interactive Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master. Players describe actions in text or voice, and the AI narrates the story, rolls dice, tracks character stats, reveals a procedurally generated dungeon map, and adapts the world in real time.

### DM Tool Use

Claude has thirteen tools it may invoke while generating a response:

| Tool | Category | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `roll_dice` | Dice | Server rolls dice (`NdX+M`) and broadcasts result to all players; supports `secret` flag |
| `request_player_roll` | Dice | Suspends generation, asks a specific player to roll, awaits their result; supports `advantage`/`disadvantage` |
| `update_character` | State | Applies HP delta, adds/removes items or conditions, updates XP, spell slots, resources, currency, hit dice, exhaustion, death saves, concentration, inspiration, backstory fields, features, and appends audit log entries |
| `update_world_state` | State | Merges key-value facts into the campaign's persistent world state |
| `reveal_area` | Map | Marks a dungeon room as explored and broadcasts a `map_update` to lift fog of war |
| `start_combat` | Combat | Begins a new encounter with a list of combatants and their initiatives; broadcasts `combat_update` |
| `next_turn` | Combat | Advances initiative order to the next combatant; increments round at end of rotation; broadcasts `combat_update` |
| `end_combat` | Combat | Clears the active encounter; broadcasts a `combat_update` with `active: false` |
| `upsert_npc` | NPCs | Adds or updates an NPC (name, faction, attitude, location, notes) in the campaign registry; broadcasts `npc_update` |
| `upsert_quest` | Quests | Adds or updates a quest (name, status, description) in the campaign quest log; broadcasts `quest_update` |
| `update_party_state` | Party | Updates party shared gold and inventory; broadcasts `party_update` |
| `generate_scene_image` | Illustration | Calls DALL-E 3 to generate an atmospheric scene image; broadcasts `scene_image` |
| `generate_loot` | Loot | Generates CR-appropriate treasure via Claude Haiku; returns an item list |

### Context Management

Sessions use a rolling-window strategy to stay within the Claude context limit:

- When a session accumulates more than **30 messages**, the oldest messages are condensed into a `session_summary` (using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for efficiency) and dropped from the active window. The most recent **20 messages** are always kept verbatim.
- When a new session starts, the previous session's summary is automatically inherited so the DM has full story continuity across play nights.

### Dungeon Map

The map is generated once per campaign using a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm and stored as a JSON grid in the database:

- The grid holds 3 tile types: `0` = wall, `1` = floor, `2` = corridor.
- Rooms are connected by L-shaped corridors using Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm so every room is reachable with no redundant paths.
- Four room archetypes — **entrance**, **boss**, **treasure**, and **generic** — are assigned deterministically from curated name pools.
- **Fog of war**: only rooms listed in `explored_rooms` (and corridors reachable from them) are visible. The DM calls `reveal_area` to update the list; clients receive a `map_update` WebSocket push and re-render immediately.
- **Map annotations**: the DM can place freeform pins on the map; they are persisted per-campaign and broadcast as `map_annotation_update` to active sessions.

### Combat Tracker

Combat state is managed in memory by `GameStateManager.CombatState` (not persisted). When the DM calls `start_combat` the server:

1. Sorts combatants by initiative descending.
2. Broadcasts a `combat_update` WebSocket message to all players.
3. The frontend auto-opens the Combat Tracker sidebar panel.

Subsequent `next_turn` calls advance the tracker (and increment the round at the end of each rotation); `end_combat` clears it.

Each `Combatant` tracks: `name`, `initiative`, `hp_current`, `hp_max`, `is_player`, `character_id`, `conditions`, `legendary_actions_remaining`, `legendary_actions_max`, and `reaction_used`.

### NPC Tracker

NPCs are stored as a JSON array in the `campaign.npcs` column. The DM calls `upsert_npc` to add or update an entry; existing records are matched by `id` (a snake_case slug). The full registry is broadcast as `npc_update` after every change and displayed in the NPC Tracker sidebar panel grouped by attitude (friendly / neutral / hostile / unknown).

### Quest Tracker

Quests are stored as a JSON array in the `campaign.quests` column. The DM calls `upsert_quest` to add or update entries; existing records are matched by `id` (a snake_case slug). The full list is broadcast as `quest_update` after every change and displayed in the Quest Tracker sidebar panel grouped by status:

- **Active** — shown in gold, with full name and description
- **Completed** — shown in green
- **Failed** — shown in red

In the DM's system prompt only active quests are expanded in full; completed and failed quests appear as a summary count to keep context bounded as campaigns progress.

### Virtual Dice Roller

The `DiceRoller` component provides in-browser rolling when a physical camera or external dice are not available:

- Supports d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100.
- Count (1–10) and modifier (+/− any integer) are adjustable before rolling.
- Rolls use `crypto.getRandomValues` for cryptographically uniform results.
- When a `pendingRoll` is active (DM called `request_player_roll`) the roller auto-selects the correct die type parsed from the `NdX` notation, displays the skill name and DC, and exposes a **Submit Roll** button that sends a `manual_roll` WebSocket message.
- For freeform rolls a **Send to Chat** button broadcasts the result as a player action so all participants see it.
- The last six rolls are kept in a history list.

### Scene Illustration

When the DM calls `generate_scene_image` the server sends a description string to DALL-E 3 (via the OpenAI REST API) with a fantasy art style prefix, then broadcasts the resulting image URL as a `scene_image` WebSocket message. The frontend shows the image as a full-width dismissable hero banner above the narrative log. Scene generation requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set; if the key is absent the tool raises an error which the DM can narrate around.

### Campaign Authentication

Each campaign has a randomly generated access code returned at creation time. Clients must include it as the `X-Access-Code` request header on all write operations (create session, update campaign, delete campaign, manage characters) and as the `access_code` WebSocket query parameter. The code is stored in `localStorage` and applied automatically by the frontend API client.

Connecting to WebSocket **without** an access code grants read-only spectator access; connecting with an **incorrect** non-empty code is rejected with close code 4403.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** with `pip`
- **Node.js 18+** with `npm`
- **Anthropic API key** (required)
- **ElevenLabs API key** (optional — for premium TTS)
- **OpenAI API key** (optional — for OpenAI TTS and DALL-E 3 scene illustration)

---

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended for production)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (and optionally ELEVENLABS_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY)

docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — the backend serves the compiled frontend directly.
The SQLite database is persisted in a Docker named volume (`db_data`).

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scwleung/ai_dungeon_master.git
cd ai_dungeon_master

# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

Configure environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY at minimum
```

Run:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (hot-reload)
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend dev server (Vite proxy → backend)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

---

## WebSocket Protocol

Connect to `ws://<host>/ws/{session_id}?player_id=<id>&player_name=<name>&access_code=<code>`.

- Omitting `access_code` grants read-only **spectator** access.
- A wrong non-empty `access_code` is rejected with close code **4403**.

## Running Tests

### Backend

```bash
# From the project root
pytest
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm test          # watch mode
npm run test:run  # single pass (CI)
```

### E2E (Playwright)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build    # or: npm run dev in a separate terminal
npm run e2e      # runs all tests in frontend/e2e/
```

Tests mock all API responses, so no running backend is required.

---

## Multiplayer Setup

All players connect to the same `session_id`. A session is created via the REST API (or the UI's "Start New Session" button) and then shared as a URL or room code.

- **Solo**: one browser tab, one player
- **Local co-op**: multiple browser tabs or devices on the same network pointing at the same backend
- **Remote**: expose the backend (e.g. via a tunnel or cloud deploy) and share the session URL

The WebSocket hub broadcasts all DM narration, dice results, map reveals, and state updates to every connected player in the room simultaneously.

### Invite Links

The player who created the campaign holds its access code and is considered the DM. To invite others:

1. In the Campaign Detail view or the session top-bar, click **Invite** (DM-only button).
2. A URL is copied to the clipboard: `https://<host>/?campaign=<id>&code=<token>`.
3. Recipients open the link — the app reads the params on startup, stores the token, and navigates directly to the campaign.

The access code grants write access (start sessions, update characters) but does **not** grant DM UI controls; those are reserved for the client that holds the token in `localStorage` from the original campaign creation.

---

## Themes

Three themes are available and can be toggled in the header without reloading the page:

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| **Fantasy** | Parchment tones, serif headings — classic tabletop feel |
| **HUD** | Dark background, cyan accents — sci-fi tactical display |
| **Minimal** | Clean whites and greys — distraction-free reading |

Themes are implemented via CSS custom properties on `document.body` and persisted in `localStorage`.

---

## Development Notes

- The frontend dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to `http://localhost:8000` via Vite's built-in proxy.
- The Anthropic API key is never exposed to the browser; all Claude calls happen server-side.
- `GameStateManager` holds in-memory session state (pending rolls, combat tracker, connected players) that is **not** persisted across server restarts. Persistent data (messages, character HP, world state, dungeon maps, NPC registry) is always written to the database immediately.
- **WS keepalive**: the server sends `{"type":"ping"}` every 30 seconds from the `_ws_keepalive` async task; the client must reply with `{"type":"pong"}`. The keepalive task is cancelled in the WebSocket handler's `finally` block.
- **Secret rolls**: the `dm_secret_roll` WS message triggers a server-side dice roll whose result is sent only to the requesting socket via `send_to_socket`, never broadcast to other players.
- **Rate limiting**: sliding-window (60 req/min/IP) implemented in-memory using `collections.defaultdict(deque)` and `time.monotonic()`. Loopback IPs (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) and the test client are exempt.
- **PWA**: `frontend/public/manifest.json` + `frontend/public/sw.js` cache-first service worker registered in `main.tsx`. The app is installable on desktop and mobile.
- **Character features**: the `features` JSON column stores `[{id, name, description, uses_remaining, uses_max, recharge}]` objects. The `feature_use` field in `CharacterUpdate` (and the equivalent WS payload) accepts `{feature_id, delta}` to atomically adjust `uses_remaining`.
- **Session recap**: `POST /api/campaigns/sessions/{id}/recap` calls Claude Haiku with session notes and pinned notes as context; returns `{"recap": "...text..."}`.
- Dice rolls triggered by Claude tools are server-side only. Camera-detected and manual rolls come from the client and are trusted as submitted.
- The dungeon map is generated once per campaign and stored in `campaign.map_data`. Use `POST /api/campaigns/{id}/map/generate` (with access code) to regenerate it; note that this resets `explored_rooms` too.
- Combat state lives only in memory. If the server restarts mid-combat the tracker will be empty on reconnect, though character HP already updated by `update_character` tool calls is persisted normally.
- Scene illustration requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If the key is absent, `generate_scene_image` raises a `RuntimeError` which surfaces as a system error message in the narrative log; the session continues normally.
- NPC records are stored in the `campaign.npcs` JSON column. The DM's `upsert_npc` tool matches existing NPCs by `id` (a snake_case slug) so repeat calls update rather than duplicate.
- Quest records are stored in the `campaign.quests` JSON column. Only active quests are expanded in the DM system prompt — completed and failed quests appear as a count to keep token usage bounded.
- `isDM` is derived entirely on the frontend from whether a campaign access token exists in `campaignTokens` (Zustand / `localStorage`). There is no separate backend role concept; the access code is the sole credential.
- The virtual dice roller uses `crypto.getRandomValues` for cryptographically uniform results — not `Math.random()`. When a `pendingRoll` is active the roller pre-selects the requested die type from the `NdX` notation and its Submit button sends the result to the server as a `manual_roll` WebSocket message.
- Context summarisation uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for cost efficiency. The rolling threshold and keep-recent window are configurable via `SUMMARY_THRESHOLD` and `SUMMARY_KEEP_RECENT` in `backend/main.py`.
